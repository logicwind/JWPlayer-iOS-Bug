The JWConviva target illustrates how to use 3rd party analytics libraries such as Conviva. The example provides the understanding of how to create an analytics observer and pass video and ads data to the Conviva library. Please note that you need to set your key and service url in the code in order to see the tracked data within the Conviva dashboard.

Please refer to the Conviva documentation to get understanding of what data can be collected by the library so that you can develop your own custom analytics listener that matches your needs.
